SETTING UP THE SIMULATION:
In order to run the simulations one first needs to install the finite element package
	FIREDRAKE	https://www.firedrakeproject.org/
After successful installation, start the virtual environment provided by firedrake:
	Navigate to the firedrake directory and use "source bin/activate" in the terminal. 
Next, install the package 	
	TQDM		https://tqdm.github.io/
This can be done by running "pip install tqdm"
The setup is complete and the virtual enviroment can be deactivated by running "deactivate"


RUNNING THE SIMULATION:
We first need to start firedrake's virtual environment:
	Navigate to the firedrake directory and use "source bin/activate" in the terminal. 
Now, navigate to the directory 'NSE-transport'.
The numerical simulations are started by running:
	python3 run_experiment{01,02,03,04,05}.py
The energy plots are generated by running:
	python3 run_into_{deterministic,additive,multilpicative,transport}.py
